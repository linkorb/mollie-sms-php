# linkorb/mollie-sms-php

## What is it?

This is an unofficial repository, mirroring the Mollie SMS PHP library and making it composer-ready.

We created this repo to simplify including this library into your projects.

## Benefits:

* A direct mirror of the library, available through git
* Made composer-ready, simply add `linkorb/mollie-sms-php`
* Stripped the examples to keep it small

The original library, including examples, can be downloaded from the Mollie website.

## More information

For more information regarding this library and the API, please visit http://www.mollie.nl/support/documentatie/sms-diensten/sms/http/


## Maintenance

When new versions of the library are release, we intend to update this repo fast.

Contributions and pull-requests welcome!
